# Evaluating job offers

So you got a job offer. CONGRATULATIONS! You are 99% done.

:::warning
Employment offers can be rescinded. This happens rarely, either due to economic turmoil or if you somehow mess up:

- bad review from your references
- negotiating too hard
- communicating poorly or unprofessionally
- going silent or taking too long to respond
:::

Here are a some tips:

### Employment Agreement

You should receive a letter from the employer including your title, salary, and starting date. This is the employment agreement. There are usually other details such as vacation, benefits, responsibilities, etc.

Review it carefully.

### Let us know

As soon as you get the offer, let Sahand or Jan know. They can help you understand the offer better and provide some insights about the company.

### Should I negotiate the offer?

Since you are a junior in this sector you don't have much choice, so you don't want to negotiate anything strongly. If you have any concerns, let Sahand or Jan know and they'll help you out.

Feel free to negotiate the starting date. Generally, it's ok to move it a couple weeks. Be clear and honest in your communications and explain why, e.g. trip, notice to current job, ... 

You don't have any negotiating power over: vacation, benefits, probationary period, ... . These are generally decided at the company-level and not per individual.

### Signing

Sign it in a timely fashion, generally a few days. If you need more time, let us know so we can advice.
